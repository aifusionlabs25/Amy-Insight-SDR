EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — AMY (INSIGHT SDR X-AGENT) v1.2

WHAT AMY DOES
Amy is an SDR-style X-Agent built to run consultative discovery conversations for Insight prospects, qualify opportunities using BANT, and route qualified leads to the correct human specialist (AE / solutions architect / AI specialist / security / IPS).

WHY THIS MATTERS
- Faster response to inbound leads (24/7 availability)
- Consistent discovery quality (no fatigue, no variance)
- Higher-quality meetings (BANT captured + correct routing)
- Reduced human SDR load (focus humans on high-value conversations)

SCOPE (WHAT’S INCLUDED)
- System prompt + persona context defining behavior and boundaries
- 9 KB modules covering:
  - company + solution pillars
  - solutions catalog and deal sizing guidance (ranges only)
  - industries + IPS routing
  - partner ecosystem language
  - proof points and credibility anchors
  - discovery question framework
  - objections and responses
  - competitive positioning and differentiation
  - compliance + privacy guardrails
- Demo scenarios to validate performance
- Source log for traceability (links referenced in the provided pack)

WHAT AMY IS NOT
- Not a closer; does not negotiate contracts
- Not a pricing authority; does not quote exact fees
- Not legal/compliance counsel; does not provide audit guidance beyond high-level
- Not a repository for sensitive data; refuses credentials/PII/PHI

RECOMMENDED PILOT (30 DAYS)
Week 1: Configure Amy in Tavus; run demo scenarios; refine prompts.
Week 2: Soft launch on low-risk inbound channels (web form follow-ups).
Week 3: Expand to higher-volume channels; measure routing accuracy.
Week 4: Decide scale path; define human handoff workflow.

SUCCESS METRICS
- BANT completeness: >85% of qualified conversations
- Correct routing: >90% (AE vs specialist vs IPS)
- Meeting conversion: at or above human SDR baseline
- Compliance: zero do-not-contact violations; zero sensitive-data capture

RISKS & MITIGATIONS
- Risk: Overpromising outcomes
  - Mitigation: “no guarantees” guardrails + escalation triggers
- Risk: KB drift (stale stats / awards)
  - Mitigation: monthly source refresh using source log
- Risk: Public sector mishandling
  - Mitigation: immediate IPS routing rule

DECISION
This pack is ready for demo deployment and controlled pilot. The recommended next step is to run the 4 demo scenarios, then deploy in a limited inbound workflow with measured handoff outcomes.
