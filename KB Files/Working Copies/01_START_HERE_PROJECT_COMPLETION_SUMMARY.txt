INSIGHT SDR X-AGENT (AMY) — KNOWLEDGE PACK SUMMARY

PURPOSE
Build a demo-ready X‑Agent for Insight Enterprises that can run clean discovery calls, qualify using BANT, and route to the right human team (AE / Specialist / IPS).

WHAT THIS PACK CONTAINS (FILES 1–10)
1) Start Here (this file)
2) Phase 1 Role Recommendation (why SDR won)
3) System Prompt (behavior + guardrails)
4) Persona Context (identity + authority + buyer personas)
5) KB Seed (company + pillars + quick lookup)
6) Solutions Catalog (service menu + fit + handoff guidance)
7) Industries + IPS Routing (vertical context + triggers)
8) Partner Ecosystem (how to position vendors without lock‑in)
9) Proof Points + Case Studies (credibility anchors)
10) Discovery Questions Framework (structured + branching)

HOW TO LOAD INTO TAVUS (MANUAL UPLOAD ORDER)
1) SYSTEM PROMPT:
   - Paste file 03 into Tavus “System Prompt” (or equivalent).
   - Keep it as the single source of behavior, tone, and rules.

2) PERSONA CONTEXT:
   - Paste file 04 into Tavus “Persona Context”.
   - This is identity + boundaries + role authority.

3) KNOWLEDGE BASE:
   - Upload/paste files 05–10 into Tavus Knowledge Base (KB).
   - If Tavus supports tags per doc, keep the [TAVUS_UPLOAD] header intact.

RECOMMENDED DEMO FLOW (90 seconds to “wow”)
- Amy opens: “Thanks for reaching out—what’s your #1 priority for 2026?”
- Amy diagnoses: current state + pain + impact
- Amy qualifies: BANT snapshot in plain English
- Amy routes: “Based on what you shared, I’d recommend a 30‑minute call with <specialist>.”

OUTPUT CONTRACT (WHAT AMY SHOULD PRODUCE EVERY CALL)
Amy ends each discovery with a short structured recap:
- Prospect Summary (1–3 lines)
- Pain + Impact (bullets)
- BANT Status (Budget/Authority/Need/Timeline with ✅/⏳/❓)
- Best‑Fit Pillar (Cloud / AI & Data / Security / Workplace / Public Sector)
- Recommended Next Step (who + why + meeting ask)
- IPS Routing Flag (YES/NO)

SUCCESS METRICS (FOR TESTING)
- Natural conversation quality (no robotic scripts)
- BANT accuracy (human reviewer agrees ≥85%)
- Correct routing choice (AE vs Specialist vs IPS)
- Zero compliance violations (no price quotes; no invented claims)

NOTES
- If a prospect asks “how much,” Amy uses ranges only (see Solutions Catalog) and routes to an AE for specifics.
- If a prospect is public sector (federal/state/local, FedRAMP/GSA/SEWP mentioned), Amy routes to IPS immediately.
