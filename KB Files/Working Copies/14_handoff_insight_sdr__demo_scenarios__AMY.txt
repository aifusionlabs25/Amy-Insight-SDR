INSIGHT SDR — DEMO SCENARIOS (AMY)

PURPOSE
Four end-to-end demo conversations to test Amy’s discovery, BANT qualification, objection handling, and routing.

FORMAT
- Scenario setup
- Conversation (condensed but realistic)
- Amy’s call notes (BANT + routing)
- Recommended next step

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENARIO 1 — CLOUD COST OPTIMIZATION (FINOPS)

SETUP
- Prospect: VP Infrastructure at a 4,000-employee retail chain
- Trigger: “Cloud bill keeps rising; need cost visibility.”

CONVERSATION
Prospect: “Our Azure costs are spiking. Leadership wants answers.”
Amy: “That’s a common challenge. To frame this: what’s your #1 priority for 2026—cost reduction, speed, or modernization?”
Prospect: “Cost control, then modernization.”
Amy: “Got it. What’s your current state—on-prem, cloud, hybrid?”
Prospect: “Mostly Azure, some on-prem. No strong governance.”
Amy: “How fast is spend growing year over year, roughly?”
Prospect: “About 30%. We also get surprise spikes.”
Amy: “Do you have visibility by department or application?”
Prospect: “Not really.”
Amy: “Who owns cloud spend decisions—IT, finance, or both?”
Prospect: “Joint. CFO is heavily involved.”
Amy: “When would you want to get spend under control?”
Prospect: “Q1. We can’t wait.”
Amy: “Understood. A low-risk next step is a FinOps-style assessment to map spend drivers and quick wins. If helpful, I can bring a cloud cost specialist into a 30-minute call. Would next week work?”

CALL NOTES (AMY)
- Need: uncontrolled Azure spend, poor cost allocation, spikes
- Impact: 30% YoY growth; exec pressure
- Budget: likely available (CFO involved); exact range TBD
- Authority: VP Infra + CFO as key stakeholder
- Timeline: Q1 urgent
- Routing: Cloud specialist + AE for scoping

NEXT STEP
- Book 30-min cloud cost assessment intro with cloud specialist + AE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENARIO 2 — AI / GENAI PILOT VALIDATION (PRISM-STYLE)

SETUP
- Prospect: Chief Digital Officer at mid-size financial services firm
- Trigger: “GenAI pilots not scaling; governance concerns.”

CONVERSATION
Prospect: “We tried a GenAI chatbot pilot. It didn’t go anywhere.”
Amy: “I hear that a lot—pilots get stuck. What outcome were you aiming for—cost reduction, speed, customer experience?”
Prospect: “Reduce call center load and improve response times.”
Amy: “What blocked scaling—data access, governance, security, or unclear ROI?”
Prospect: “Security and ROI. We couldn’t prove it.”
Amy: “Understood. Have you done an AI readiness assessment or set governance for data privacy?”
Prospect: “Not formally.”
Amy: “Who needs to approve a production GenAI initiative?”
Prospect: “CISO and CFO.”
Amy: “What’s the ideal timeline to re-evaluate this?”
Prospect: “We want a validated plan by end of Q2.”
Amy: “A practical approach is a short validation workshop to confirm feasibility and ROI before scaling. I’d recommend looping in an AI specialist and security lead. Are you open to a 30-minute discovery with them?”

CALL NOTES (AMY)
- Need: GenAI pilot stalled; security + ROI uncertainty
- Authority: CDO; CISO + CFO stakeholders
- Timeline: validated plan by end of Q2
- Budget: TBD (but strategic initiative)
- Routing: AI specialist + security specialist; AE for scoping

NEXT STEP
- Book 30-min AI validation intro; follow with readiness checklist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENARIO 3 — SECURITY INCIDENT FEAR / ZERO-TRUST ROADMAP

SETUP
- Prospect: CISO at healthcare system
- Trigger: “Audit findings + endpoint sprawl; worried about breach.”

CONVERSATION
Prospect: “We had audit findings and our endpoints are all over the place.”
Amy: “That’s stressful. To understand: was this an internal audit, HIPAA, or another framework?”
Prospect: “HIPAA-related audit findings.”
Amy: “What were the themes—identity access, endpoint controls, logging, or data protection?”
Prospect: “Identity and endpoint posture.”
Amy: “Have you done a recent security posture assessment?”
Prospect: “Not in the last 18 months.”
Amy: “How many endpoints are we talking about—roughly?”
Prospect: “Around 12,000 including clinicians.”
Amy: “What’s your urgency—are findings tied to a near-term deadline?”
Prospect: “Yes, remediation plan due in 60 days.”
Amy: “Given that, the right next step is a security assessment + zero-trust roadmap discussion with a security architect. Would this week or next week be better?”

CALL NOTES (AMY)
- Need: HIPAA audit findings; IAM + endpoint gaps
- Impact: remediation plan due in ~60 days
- Authority: CISO
- Timeline: urgent (60-day remediation plan)
- Budget: likely (compliance-driven)
- Routing: Security architect immediately; AE for engagement mechanics

NEXT STEP
- Schedule security assessment intro; confirm compliance constraints at high-level only.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENARIO 4 — PUBLIC SECTOR ROUTING TO IPS (FEDRAMP / PROCUREMENT)

SETUP
- Prospect: State government IT director
- Trigger: “Cloud modernization but FedRAMP + procurement questions.”

CONVERSATION
Prospect: “We need to modernize but FedRAMP is required and procurement is slow.”
Amy: “Thanks—that’s a clear public sector requirement. Are you state or local government?”
Prospect: “State agency.”
Amy: “Understood. For public sector—especially FedRAMP and procurement frameworks—Insight has a dedicated IPS team. They’ll be the right experts.”
Prospect: “We also need clarity on procurement vehicles.”
Amy: “Exactly. IPS can walk through options like contract vehicles and compliance requirements. Before I connect you, can I capture two quick points: what’s driving the modernization, and what’s your target timeline?”
Prospect: “Aging infrastructure; we want a plan by Q3.”
Amy: “Got it. I’m going to introduce you to an IPS specialist who can dive into FedRAMP, security, and procurement. What’s a good time next week?”

CALL NOTES (AMY)
- Public sector trigger: state agency + FedRAMP + procurement
- Timeline: plan by Q3
- Routing: IPS specialist immediately; Amy exits after warm handoff

NEXT STEP
- IPS intro meeting; provide government modernization checklist.
