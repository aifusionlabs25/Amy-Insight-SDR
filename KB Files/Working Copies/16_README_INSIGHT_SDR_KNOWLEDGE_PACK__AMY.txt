README — AMY (INSIGHT SDR) KNOWLEDGE PACK v1.2

WHAT THIS IS
A complete, paste-ready set of TXT files for building an Insight SDR X-Agent named “Amy” in Tavus.

PACKAGE CONTENTS (17 FILES)
01  Project completion summary (meta)
02  Role selection recommendation (meta)
03  System prompt (agent behavior)
04  Persona context (identity + boundaries)
05–13 Knowledge base files (SDR reference library)
14–15 Handoff / demo tools (scenarios + source log)
16  This README
17  Executive summary (leadership brief)

UPLOAD PLAN (TAVUS — MANUAL)
1) SYSTEM PROMPT
- Use: 03_agents_insight_sdr__system_prompt__AMY.txt
- Paste into: Tavus → Agent → System Prompt

2) PERSONA / CONTEXT
- Use: 04_agents_insight_sdr__persona_context__AMY.txt
- Paste into: Tavus → Agent → Persona Context (or equivalent field)

3) KNOWLEDGE BASE (KB)
- Use: 05–13 files
- Recommended: upload as separate KB entries (one per file) to keep retrieval tight.
- If Tavus forces single KB blob: concatenate 05–13 in order.

4) DEMO TESTING
- Use: 14_handoff_insight_sdr__demo_scenarios__AMY.txt
- Run the scenarios and confirm Amy:
  - stays discovery-first
  - applies BANT
  - routes to IPS when public sector triggers appear
  - refuses pricing/contract promises

Each file starts with a [TAVUS_UPLOAD] block that includes:
- AGENT_NAME (Amy)

- DOC_ID and TAGS (used for your internal SOP + search)

VERSIONING
- VERSION: 1.2 across the new set
- EFFECTIVE_DATE: 2026-01-27 (match your project date)
- Update VERSION when you revise content; keep prior versions archived.

QUALITY / SAFETY NOTES
- No exact pricing quotes (use ranges; route to AE)

RECOMMENDED KPI CHECKS (PILOT)
- BANT capture rate (Budget/Authority/Need/Timeline)
- Correct routing rate (AE vs SA vs AI vs Security vs IPS)

- “Do-not-contact” compliance (0 violations)
- Prospect satisfaction (simple 1–5 rating)
