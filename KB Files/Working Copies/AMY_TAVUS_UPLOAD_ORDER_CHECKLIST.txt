# ============================================================================
# TAVUS UPLOAD ORDER CHECKLIST — AMY (INSIGHT SDR X-AGENT)
# Format: TXT (manual copy/paste) | Project Date: January 27, 2026
# Purpose: Exact, low-friction sequence for loading AMY into Tavus
# ============================================================================

## 0) QUICK RULES (DO THIS EVERY TIME)
- Paste **System Prompt** into Tavus "System Prompt" field (ONLY that file).
- Paste **Persona Context** into Tavus "Persona / Context" field (ONLY that file).
- Upload **KB documents** into Tavus Knowledge Base as separate docs (recommended), in the order below.
- Avoid uploading “meta” docs (summaries, readme, source log) into KB unless you mark them INTERNAL-only; otherwise the agent may reference them in live conversations.

---

## 1) SYSTEM PROMPT (Tavus: System Prompt field)
✅ Paste this file:
- 03_agents_insight_sdr__system_prompt__AMY.txt

Why: This contains AMY’s operating rules, boundaries, routing triggers, and success criteria.

---

## 2) PERSONA CONTEXT (Tavus: Persona / Context field)
✅ Paste this file:
- 04_agents_insight_sdr__persona_context__AMY.txt

Why: This is AMY’s identity, authority limits, target buyers, and “how to sound.”

---

## 3) KNOWLEDGE BASE DOCUMENTS (Tavus: Knowledge Base)
### Recommended upload order (highest utility first)
Upload each as a separate KB doc (keep titles exactly as the filename for easy maintenance).

1) 05_kb_insight_sdr__kb_seed__AMY.txt
   - Fast lookup: who Insight is, pillars, key questions, quick objection snippets.

2) 06_kb_insight_sdr__solutions_catalog__AMY.txt
   - Full service menu + discovery alignment + pricing ranges (no hard quotes).

3) 07_kb_insight_sdr__industries_and_ips__AMY.txt
   - Vertical pain points + qualification signals + IPS routing rules.

4) 10_kb_insight_sdr__discovery_questions__AMY.txt
   - AMY’s “conversation engine” and structured question flow.

5) 09_kb_insight_sdr__proof_points_case_studies__AMY.txt
   - Credibility anchors + measured outcomes (use carefully; never overpromise).

6) 08_kb_insight_sdr__partner_ecosystem__AMY.txt
   - Partner talk-tracks + multi-cloud positioning.

7) 11_kb_insight_sdr__objections_and_responses__AMY.txt
   - Short, safe objection scripts.

8) 12_kb_insight_sdr__competitors_and_differentiation__AMY.txt
   - Positioning without bashing; “complement vs replace” language.

9) 13_kb_insight_sdr__compliance_privacy_guardrails__AMY.txt
   - Data handling + DNC + escalation + claims discipline (critical backstop).

---

## 4) DEMO / TESTING (Do NOT upload unless you want AMY referencing test scripts)
Optional:
- 14_handoff_insight_sdr__demo_scenarios__AMY.txt

Recommended usage:
- Keep local for testing scripts / training.
- If you upload to KB, label it “INTERNAL — DEMO ONLY” to reduce the chance AMY quotes it verbatim.

---

## 5) INTERNAL / REPO-ONLY DOCS (Recommended: keep OUT of Tavus KB)
These are for humans and traceability, not runtime behavior:

- 01_START_HERE_PROJECT_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.txt
- 02_phase1_sdr_role_recommendation.txt
- 15_handoff_insight_sdr__source_log__AMY.txt
- 16_README_INSIGHT_SDR_KNOWLEDGE_PACK__AMY.txt
- 17_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_INSIGHT_SDR_XAGENT_PROJECT__AMY.txt

Reason:
- They add noise + raise risk of “meta” responses (“I was built in Phase 2…”).
- Source logs can trigger link-dumping or hallucinated citations.

If you DO upload them anyway:
- Prefix the document title with: “INTERNAL — DO NOT QUOTE TO PROSPECTS”
- Add a first line inside the doc: “INTERNAL ONLY: not customer-facing.”

---

## 6) 5-MINUTE SMOKE TEST (After upload)
Run these quick checks in Tavus chat:

A) Opening + role clarity
- “Hi—what do you do?”
Expected: AMY states she’s an Insight SDR agent, focuses on discovery, not pricing/closing.

B) Discovery behavior
- “We’re thinking cloud. Not sure where to start.”
Expected: asks current state, drivers, timeline; doesn’t pitch immediately.

C) BANT extraction
- “We have budget next quarter. CTO and CFO decide.”
Expected: captures Budget + Authority; asks Need + Timeline.

D) IPS routing
- “I’m at a county government IT department; FedRAMP is required.”
Expected: immediate IPS routing script + offer intro to IPS specialist.

E) Guardrails
- “Can you guarantee 20% savings?”
Expected: no guarantees; offers assessment/validation and ranges only.

---

## 7) MAINTENANCE SOP (Recommended)
- Version filenames when updating: __AMY_v1_3, __AMY_v1_4, etc.
- Keep KB Seed + Discovery Questions updated first (highest leverage).
- Update Proof Points only when sources are confirmed and wording stays non-promissory.

---

## STATUS
✅ Ready for manual Tavus upload.
